Abstract:</span><br>

No legged walking robot yet approaches the high reliability and the low
power usage of a walking person, even on flat ground. Here we describe
a simple robot which makes a small progress towards that goal. Ranger
is a knee-less 4-legged &#8216;bipedal&#8217; robot which is energeti- cally and
computationally autonomous, except for radio controlled steering.
Ranger walked 65.2 km in 186,076 steps in about 31 hours without being
touched by a human with a total cost of transport [TCOT &#8801; P/mgv] of
0.28, similar to human&#8217;s TCOT of &#8776; 0.3. The high reliability and low
energy use were achieved by: 1) development of an accurate bench-test-
based simulation; 2) development of an intuitively tuned nominal
trajectory based on simple locomotion models; and 3) offline design of
a simple reflex-based (that is, event-driven dis- crete feed-forward)
stabilizing controller. Further, once we replaced the intuitively tuned
nominal trajectory with a trajectory found from a numerical
optimization, but still using event-based control, we could further
reduce the TCOT to 0.19. At TCOT = 0.19, the robot&#8217;s total power of
11.5W is used by sensors, processors and communications (45%), motor
dissipation (&#8776;34%) and positive mechanical work (&#8776;21%). Ranger&#8217;s
reliability and low energy use suggests that simplified implementation
of offline trajectory optimization, stabilized by a low-bandwidth
reflex-based controller, might lead to energy-effective reliable
walking of more complex robots.<br>

simplest slope walker reveals a wide range of walking solutions</a>.
Transactions on Robotics, Vol 30, Issue 5, June 2014.\<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
<br>

Abstract:<br>

We show that the simplest slope walker can walk over wide combinations
of step lengths and step velocities at a given ramp slope by proper
choice of foot placement. We are able to find walking solutions up to
slope of 15.42 degrees, beyond which the ground reaction force on the
stance leg goes to zero, implying a flight phase. We also show that the
simplest walker can walk at human sized step length and step velocity
at a slope of 6.62 degrees. The central idea behind control using foot
placement is to balance the potential energy gained during descent with
the energy lost during collision at foot-strike. Finally, we give some
suggestions on how the ideas from foot placement control and energy
balance can be extended to realize walking motions on practical legged
systems.<small><br>

Robotica, pp. 1--11, June 2014.<br>

<br>
<big><big><small>Abstract:<br>
</small></big><small>In this paper, we present a theoretical study on
the control of a compass gait walker using energy regulation between
steps. We use a return map to relate the mid-stance robot kinetic
energy between steps with the two control inputs, namely, foot
placement and ankle push-off. We show that by regulating the robot
kinetic energy between steps using the two control inputs, we are able
to: 1) generate a wide range of walking speeds and stride lengths,
including average human walking; 2) cancel the effect of external
disturbance fully in a single step (dead-beat control); and, 3) switch
from one periodic gait to another in a single step. We hope that
insights from this control methodology can help develop robust
controllers for practical bipedal robots.</small></big><big><big><small><small><br>

- Dead beat (perfect correction) of disturbances in finite time is
possible using a discrete controllers. Further, demonstrated that it is
possible to control systems with significant time delays. For example,
we balance a pendulum with a time constant of 0.33 sec by sensing
*once* per second. In other words, time delay was three times the
characteristic time constant of the system. The video above shows
demonstration on a simple pendulum. <br>
<br>
Abstract:<br>

In some practical control problems of essentially-continuous systems,
the goal is not to tightly track a trajectory in state space, but only
some aspects of the state at various points along the trajectory, and
possibly only loosely. Here we show examples in which classical
discrete-control approaches can provide simple, low input and low
output bandwidth con- trol of such systems. The sensing occurs at
discrete state- or time-based events. Based on the state at the event,
we set a small set of control parameters. These parameters prescribe
features, e.g. amplitudes, of open-loop commands that, as- suming
perfect modeling, force the system to, or towards, goal points in the
trajectory. Using this discrete decision con- tinuous actuation (DDCA)
control approach, we demonstrate stabilization of two examples: 1)
linear dead-beat control of a time delayed linearized inverted
pendulum; and 2) pump- ing of a hanging pendulum. Advantages of this
approach include: It is computationally cheap compared to real-time
control or online optimization; it can handle long time de- lays; it
can fully correct disturbances in finite time (dead- beat control); it
can be simple, using few control gains and set points and limited
sensing; and it is low bandwidth for both sensing and actuator
commands. We have found the approach useful for control of robotic
walking.<br>

benchmark models of walking:
the rimless wheel and the simplest walker.</a> Dynamics of
Continuous, Discrete and Impulsive Systems Series B: Applications and
Algorithms, vol. 21, pp 137--148, 2014.<br>
<br>
Abstract:<br>
The eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the return map are used to quantify
the stability of discrete dynamical systems, such as, the rimless wheel
and the simplest walker. The accuracy this Jacobian, usually obtained
by finite differencing, depends on the step size. Even with the most
optimal step size, only moderate accuracy is obtained. Here, we obtain
the Jacobian by numerically integrating the gradient of the equations
of motion. For the rimless wheel, our eigenvalue estimate is accurate
to 12 significant digits and is better than 9 significant digits
obtained by finite differencing with optimal step size obtained by
Coleman [Dynamics of Continuous, Discrete and Impulsive Systems Series
B, 16, 2009]. We first show that our method is able to produce the
eigenvalues accurate to 12 signifi- cant digits obtained by known
analytical solution for the rimless wheel. This benchmark calculation
then permits us to make the claim that the eigenvalues of the simplest
walker, for which the analytical solution is unknown, obtained using
our method are accurate to 12 significant digits.<br>

Abstract:<br>

We present an iterative learning framework for accurate end-effector
tracking of kinematically redundant robots. The iterative learning
control update rule is in the task space and consists of adding a
correction to the desired pose of the end-effector based on tracking
errors. The corrected end- effector desired pose is then fed to an
inverse kinematics solver that computes a new joint position command
that is implemented using a joint level servo on the robot. Our
framework has the following benefits: (1) It involves very little gain
tuning. (2) It converges in a few trials. (3) It is able to find
solutions that are within joint limits. (4) It is robust to modeling
errors. (5) It works with the existing inverse kinematics solver, hence
re-programming the solver is not required. We validate our method by
testing it on a humanoid robot doing two tasks; drawing the figure
eight and serving a glass of drink.<br>

Abstract: <br>

Creating animations for entertainment humanoid robots is a time
consuming process because of high aesthetic quality requirements as
well as poor tracking performance due to small actuators used in order
to realize human size. Once deployed, such robots are also expected to
work for years with minimum downtime for maintenance. In this pa- per,
we demonstrate a successful application of an iterative learning
control algorithm to automate the process of fine tuning choreographed
human-speed motions on a 37 degree- of-freedom humanoid robot. By using
good initial feed-forward commands generated by
experimentally-identified joint models, the learning algorithm
converges in about 9 iterations and achieves almost the same fidelity
as the manually fine tuned motion.<br>
